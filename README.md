# Database-Project
A simulated police database project I made a while ago
This is an end to end system that will allow fictitious officers to record and retrieve information about vehicles, people and traffic incidents. 
To run this database you should have MySQL / Apache / PHP installed, as well as a web server. In my case, I use XAMPP.

* **Here is a list of languages I used for the project**
* SQL
* PHP
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
